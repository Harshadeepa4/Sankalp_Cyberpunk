# plantCare

## Introduction of Project

**Team Name:** CyberPunk  
**Team Leader:** Dhino Kevin B  
**Problem Statement:** Smart farming planner

**Summary:**  
plantCare is an AI-powered, multilingual, and sensor-integrated platform designed to support both experienced farmers and beginner teen farmers in India.

The project aims to reverse the declining farmer population by encouraging teen participation in farming alongside experienced farmers to maximize yield. It leverages AI and Google technologies to optimize crop yield and resource utilization. Key features include real-time irrigation control, disease detection, personalized advisory, market insights, and fertilizer recommendations.

The platform supports multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity for farmers across different regions. The sensor-driven approach allows for context-aware and personalized decision-making.

**Current Development Focus:**

- Emphasizing the implementation of core functional logic and intelligent AI features
- Prioritizing accuracy in data processing and actionable outputs
- Minimal but functional UI, designed primarily for testing and enabling interaction with core systems for the purpose of MVP

## Features of Project

- **Irrigation Optimization:** Integrates IoT and weather data to compute optimal irrigation levels for specific crops.
- **Image-Based Disease Detection:** Uses a machine learning model in combination with Gemini Vision API to identify and diagnose plant diseases from images.
- **Text Support:** Enables farmers to describe issues in text, which are auto-translated into their preferred language.
- **Voice Support:** Includes speech-to-text input and multilingual responses, ideal for farmers with low literacy levels.
- **Market Insights:** Uses Gemini to generate financial insights and mandi trends, visualized through Looker dashboards.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Suggests the best fertilizer based on real-time values like NPK, humidity, crop type, etc., gathered through IoT sensors.
